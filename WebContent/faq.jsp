<h4 id="a1">How do I record the shots for each hole if I choose NOT to select a club for each shot?</h4>
<p>a. Once you have hit the ball off the next, click on the <q>Next Shot</q> button. Continue to click on the next shot prior to hitting your ball until you hit the ball into the hole.<br>
b. Once you have hit the ball into the hole, click on the <q>In the Hole</q> button.<br>
c. If you had any penalty strokes during the hole, enter the additional strokes on the hole summary screen.</p>

<h4 id="a2">How do I record the shots for each hole if I choose to select a club for each shot I take?</h4>
<p>a. At the start of each hole, click on the <q>Select Club</q> button.  Choose your club and let it default to <q>tee box</q>. Click on the <q>Ready for First Shot</q> button.<br>
b. After you have taken your first shot, click on the <q>Next Shot</q> button.<br>
c. Before you take your next shot, click on the <q>Select Club</q> button. Choose your club and current ball position. Click on the <q>Submit</q>button.<br>
d. Click on the <q>Shot button</q> after you have taken your shot.<br>
e. Repeat c and d until you hit the ball in the hole. Once in the hole, click on the <q>In the Hole</q> button (instead of <q>Next Shot</q>).</p>

<h4 id="b1">How do I enter penalty shots?</h4>
<p>a. If you are not recording your club selection, you can enter your penalty strokes at the end of the hole.<br>
b. If you are recording your club selection, you can enter penalty strokes on the club selection screen after each shot.</p>

<h4 id="c1">Can I play from different tees each hole?</h4>
<p>No, the application expects you to play from the same tee the entire round as that is the way a standard round of golf is played.</p>

<h4 id="d1">Do I have to select a club on every shot I take?</h4>
<p>No, you do not have to select a club before each shot; however, if you do not select your club before each shot, the application will also not gather your lie or allow you to enter penalty strokes as they occur. Also, since you are not recording it, the information will not be available when you view history.</p>

<h4 id="e1">What if I forget my password?</h4>
<p>Password can be reset with the <q>Forgot Password</q> button</p>

<h4 id="f1">Can I see previous rounds I have played?</h4>	
<p>Yes. After login, instead of selecting <q>New Round</q>, select <q>History</q>. You will see each round you have played and then can drill down to see the round details.</p>
